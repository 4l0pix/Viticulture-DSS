# Viticulture and Wine Center
### Problem Specification:
A viticultrure and wine center faces some major problems when trying to optimize water and fertilizers management.
Non-systematic recording and analysis of data leads to:
- Excessive or insufficient irrigation
- Fertilizer waste
- Reduced productivity
- Environmental impact
The company does not have the know-how or equipment to analyze the data it already collects (or could collect) from sensors, times and harvest history.
### Innovation:
The development of a decision support system (DSS) that will propose optimal amounts of water and fertilizers per culture zone, based on previous data and weather forecast.

## Project Overview

The DSS combines simulated climate, plant, and soil data to recommend interventions for five vineyard zones. The backend is written in Python (Flask) and exposes REST endpoints. The frontend is a single-page application built with HTML, CSS, Leaflet.js, and vanilla JavaScript.

Key capabilities:

- Generate realistic daily sensor measurements for 27 sensors over two years plus 30 forecast days.
- Model seasonal climates, zone microclimates, and sensor-level variations.
- Compute irrigation and fertilization requirements per sensor region.
- Render high-resolution contour heatmaps for measured data and prescriptions.
- Provide cost breakdowns for planned interventions.
- Advanced data mining algorithms for outlier detection, clustering, and anomaly analysis.
- Data quality management with automated cleaning and sensor drift detection.

## Configuration Files

### vineyard_config.json

Central configuration describing the vineyard layout and agronomic parameters.

**Sections:**

- `zones`: Geographic boundaries for Field1–Field5 with latitude/longitude polygon vertices. Each zone has a unique `zone_id` used throughout the codebase.
- `sensors`: Lists sensor metadata (ID, coordinates) grouped by zone. Sensors cover the vineyard with 50 m radius sampling areas.
- `optimal_ranges`: Target ranges for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, and pH.
- `costs`: Economic factors such as water price per cubic meter, electricity per kWh, and fertilizer prices per kilogram for each nutrient.
- `growth_stages`: Defines phenological stages (`Dormant`, `Bud Break`, `Flowering`, `Veraison`, `Harvest`). Each stage specifies a `water_factor` (relative water demand) and `nutrient_uptake` multiplier.

---

## Python Modules

### data_generator.py

Generates synthetic historical and forecast data.

**Key components:**

- `VineyardDataGenerator` class orchestrates data creation.
- Seasonal climate profiles (`seasonal_profiles`) define typical temperature and humidity ranges for Winter/Spring/Summer/Autumn.
- Zone-level microclimate offsets (`zone_microclimate`) introduce variation per field (±1.5 °C, ±8 % humidity).
- Sensor-level variations add additional random differences (±0.5 °C, ±3 % humidity) and soil characteristics (moisture retention, drainage, nutrient depletion rates).
- `_generate_weather`: Simulates daily temperature, humidity, rainfall, solar radiation by sampling within seasonal ranges and applying noise.
- `_generate_sensor_data`: For each sensor, projects soil moisture using a water-balance equation that accounts for rainfall, evapotranspiration, and drainage. Nutrients deplete according to sensor-specific rates and plant uptake multipliers.
- Outputs CSV files (`weather_data.csv`, `sensor_data.csv`, `plant_data.csv`, `intervention_data.csv`).

### dss_algorithm.py

Implements the decision logic.

**VineyardDSS class:**

- Loads configuration and sensor/plant/intervention datasets.
- `calculate_et(temp, solar, humidity)`: Computes evapotranspiration using a Hargreaves-based formulation adjusted for humidity.
- `calculate_water_prescription(target_date)`: 
  - Uses forecast weather leading up to the target date to estimate cumulative evapotranspiration and effective rainfall.
  - Retrieves predicted sensor readings on the target date.
  - Applies growth stage water factors, residual water from recent irrigation, and a progressive time multiplier (5 % per day ahead).
  - Returns zone-level averages plus `sensor_water_needs` mapping each sensor to required irrigation (mm).
- `calculate_fertilizer_prescription(target_date)`: 
  - Uses target date nutrient levels per sensor.
  - Applies growth stage uptake multipliers and time-based increase (6 % per day ahead).
  - Returns zone averages and `sensor_fertilizer_needs` (N, P, K deficits per sensor region).
- `calculate_water_only_cost`, `calculate_fertilizer_only_cost`, `calculate_cost`: Convert prescriptions into water/fertilizer volumes, then compute total expenditure using `costs` from configuration.
- `generate_prescription`: Combines water and fertilizer calculations, aggregates cost data, and writes `prescription.json` snapshot.

### heatmap_generator.py

Handles visualization of sensor measurements and prescriptions.

**HeatmapGenerator class:**

- `generate_contour_heatmap(date, data_type)`: 
  - Loads sensor measurements for a given metric (e.g., `ground_moisture`, `temperature`).
  - Combines sensor coordinates with zone boundary vertices to create interpolation points.
  - Uses SciPy `griddata` (linear + nearest) to interpolate values across a uniform grid.
  - Masks points outside vineyard zones and renders a contour plot with 30 levels using Matplotlib.
  - Returns PNG image encoded in base64 along with map bounds.
- `generate_sensor_prescription_heatmap(sensor_prescription_data, prescription_type)`: 
  - Builds interpolation inputs from per-sensor prescriptions (`water_mm` or `N`).
  - Adds zone boundary points with averaged values to smooth transitions.
  - Produces contour heatmaps highlighting areas requiring higher interventions.

### spatial_interpolation.py

Legacy module offering inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation. The main application now uses the Matplotlib-based approach from `heatmap_generator.py`, but this module remains for potential alternative interpolation strategies.

### data_mining.py

Advanced analytics module providing comprehensive data quality management and pattern discovery capabilities for vineyard sensor data.

**VineyardDataMiner class:**

- **Outlier Detection Methods:**
  - `detect_outliers_statistical(method='both')`: Statistical approach using Z-score (threshold=3) and Interquartile Range (IQR) methods to identify sensors with anomalous readings.
  - `detect_outliers_isolation_forest(contamination=0.1)`: Machine learning approach using scikit-learn's Isolation Forest algorithm for unsupervised anomaly detection.
  - Automatically filters outliers by measurement type (temperature, humidity, moisture, nutrients, pH) with appropriate thresholds.

- **Data Cleaning Operations:**
  - `clean_outliers(method='remove')`: Multiple strategies for handling detected outliers:
    - `'remove'`: Eliminates outlier records completely
    - `'cap'`: Caps values at 95th/5th percentiles to reduce extreme values
    - `'interpolate'`: Replaces outliers with interpolated values based on temporal patterns
  - Maintains data integrity while improving analysis reliability.

- **Clustering Analysis:**
  - `cluster_sensors_spatial(n_clusters='auto')`: Groups sensors based on environmental characteristics (temperature, humidity, moisture) using K-Means clustering.
  - `cluster_temporal_patterns(n_components=3)`: Analyzes temporal behavior patterns using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by K-Means clustering.
  - `_find_optimal_clusters()`: Automatically determines optimal cluster count using elbow method and silhouette analysis.
  - Supports both predefined cluster counts and automatic optimization.

- **Anomaly Detection:**
  - `find_anomalous_zones(threshold=2.0)`: Identifies vineyard zones with consistently abnormal sensor readings compared to zone averages.
  - `detect_sensor_drift(window_days=7, threshold=0.1)`: Detects gradual sensor calibration drift by analyzing measurement stability over time windows.
  - Uses statistical methods to identify systematic measurement errors and equipment malfunctions.

## Frontend Application

### index.html Structure

A single-page interface with three primary sections:

1. **Sidebar Control Panel**
   - Data layer selector (radio buttons) for moisture, temperature, humidity, nutrients, pH.
   - DSS controls (target date input, full analysis trigger, reset button).
   - Prescription view toggle (water vs. fertilizer) shown after full analysis.
   - Cost breakdown display (total, water, electricity, fertilizer).
   - Data mining controls (analysis period selector, outlier detection, clustering, anomaly detection, comprehensive reports).
2. **Map Container** (`#map`)
   - Leaflet map centered on the vineyard with Esri satellite tiles.
3. **Modal/Popup Elements** (Leaflet popups attached to sensors/zones).

### JavaScript Logic

Key variables store map state (`map`, `zoneLayers`, `heatmapLayers`, `sensorMarkers`), data caches (`sensorData`, `sensorWaterNeeds`, `sensorFertilizerNeeds`), and UI state (`currentDate`, `currentDataType`, `currentPrescriptionView`).

Main functions:

- `init()`: Initializes map, fetches config, draws zones, sensors, and default heatmap.
- `drawZones()`: Adds Leaflet polygons for each field boundary with translucent styling.
- `drawSensors()`: Places sensor markers (red circle markers) and binds click handlers.
- `showSensorPopup(marker, sensorId)`: Displays current measurements and, when available, prescription recommendations for the specific sensor region.
- `handleLayerChange()`: Switches measurement heatmaps based on selected radio button.
- `showHeatmapLayer(dataType)`: Fetches and overlays measurement heatmap images.
- `calculateFullPrescription()`: Sends target date to `/api/prescription`, stores returned sensor-level prescriptions, updates cost display, reveals prescription view toggles, and calls `visualizePrescription()`.
- `handlePrescriptionViewChange()`: Switches between water and fertilizer heatmaps.
- `visualizePrescription()`: Generates prescription heatmap overlay via `/api/prescription-heatmap`, renders zone boundaries, and summarizes average needs in zone popups.
- `resetView()`: Clears map layers, hides prescription controls, resets cost display.
- `detectOutliers()`: Calls mining API for statistical outlier detection and highlights affected sensors on map.
- `clusterSensors()`: Performs spatial clustering analysis and visualizes sensor groups with color coding.
- `detectAnomalies()`: Identifies anomalous zones and sensor drift, highlighting problem areas.
- `generateMiningReport()`: Creates comprehensive data mining report with quality assessment and recommendations.
- `displayMiningResults(title, results)`: Shows mining analysis results in dedicated UI panel.
- `highlightSensorsOnMap(sensorIds, color)`: Visual highlighting of specific sensors for outlier/cluster visualization.
- `visualizeClusters(clusters)`: Color-codes sensors based on cluster assignments for spatial analysis.
- `highlightAnomalousZones(zones)`: Emphasizes vineyard zones with detected anomalies.

### Styling Highlights

The interface uses a glassmorphism theme with vineyard-inspired palette (`#F1F3E0`, `#D2DCB6`, `#A1BC98`, `#778873`, `#662222`). CSS applies backdrop blur, semi-transparent panels, and custom radio buttons (circular indicators without default browser styling).

## Data Files

Generated CSV datasets stored in the project root:

- `weather_data.csv`: Daily weather variables per zone.
- `sensor_data.csv`: Sensor-level measurements (temperature, humidity, moisture, nutrients, pH).
- `plant_data.csv`: Growth stage and phenology per zone.
- `intervention_data.csv`: Records of past irrigation/fertilization interventions (used to calculate residual effects).

These files are regenerated by `data_generator.py` if missing.
